# Socioexplore -- CS 4270 Internet Programming Final Project
Adapted from [this repo](https://github.com/abhn/simple-php-mysql-project) because I'm new to Github and don't know how to fork stuff.

## New features:
* A prettier, modern-styled logo made with CSS
* A rudimentary email verification system
* An incomplete follower system, meant to replace the current friend system
